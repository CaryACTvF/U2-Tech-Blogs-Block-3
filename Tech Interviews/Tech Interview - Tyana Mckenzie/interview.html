			<li class="question">How has technology changed over your lifetime?</li>

			<p class="answer">Since she was a child Alicia has seen technology become more advance, compact, sleeker.  It has more people have them and it very uncommon to meet someone who doesnt own some for of technology.  Can find them cheaper and they'd still be useful.  She also remembered not beinf able to use her phone till after 9pm because if she used it br=efore then it would run up her data, but now you can use your phone whenever.</p>

			<li class="question">Have the changes you’ve seen in technology over your lifetime mostly helped or hurt society?</li>

			<p class="answer">Technology has both helped and hurt society, its helped because now everyone can find answers to their questions through they technology.  Sadly though, because of technology people are less social, so when people are in large groups, they are more likely to be on their phones rather than be in conversation with eachother.</p>

			<p class="answer"> Alicia hopes that technology will focus on ways to help improve peoples situations with things like, proverty and different illnesses.</p>

			<li class="question">What is your greatest fear for technology in the future?</li>

			<p class="answer">  Alicia's greatest fear is that we'll go overboard with the technology being used and nobody will be able to communicate with eachother anymore, and also that people will start getting chips implanted into themselves.</p>

			<li class="question">What advice would you like to share with the younger generation about tech- nology?</li>

			<p class="answer"> Alicia wantes the younger generation to appreciate it all, because she remembers when she had to wait for dial up and if she was on the phone with anyone, once someone else tries to make a call or if someone were to call her phone she would get kicked off of her call.</p>

			<li class="question">Do you have any interesting stories about the technology you used?.</li>

			<p class="answer"> She owned a phone called a next tell and if was kind of like a walkie talkie, if she was anywhere and she heard the sound of the next tell she would assume that it was for her but it would be someone else.</p>

			<p>I liked the font you chose for the headers, it looks like a typewriter and not like a computer font. </p>

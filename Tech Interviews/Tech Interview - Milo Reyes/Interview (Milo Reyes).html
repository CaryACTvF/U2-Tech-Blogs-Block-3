		<h1>Tech Interview</h1>

		<img src="http://content.omaha.com/media/maps/online/80stech/Technology_19.JPG" alt="1970s computers">

		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p id="introduction">I interviewd my father, Carlos Reyes, who is 59 years old and a gardener. Born in 1960, he has seen a lot of technological changes over the course of his life.</p>

		<h2>Interview</h2>
		<ol class="interview">
			<li class="question">How old were you when you got your first computer?</li>

				<p class="answer">"I was 30 or 31."</p>
			
			<li class="question">What was your favorite piece of technology when they were growing up?</li>
				
				<p class="answer">"Definitely Television."</p>

			<li class="question">How has technology changed over your lifetime?</li>

				<p class="answer">"I used to listen to music on the radio and then I moved to records, and then Cassette tapes, then CDs and streaming. Films and media had a similar trajectory.</p>

			<li class="question">Have the changes youâ€™ve seen in technology over your lifetime mostly helped or hurt society?</li>

				<p class="answer">"They were headed toward helping, and then they started hurting. Big tech companies like Facebook and Google are a problem."</p>

			<li class="question">What is your greatest hope for technology in the future?</li>

				<p class="answer">"I have none. People are always motivated by making more and more money, and it's affecting the tech world. That's why I'm cynical about progress."</p>

			<li class="question">What is your greatest fear for technology in the future?</li>

				<p class="answer">"Surveilance."</p>

			<li class="question">What advice would you like to share with the younger generation about tech- nology?</li>

				<p class="answer">"Be aware of what you are doing with technology, because nothing you do is secret or personal. They are studying you."</p>

			<li class="question">How has technology affected the arts?</li>

				<p class="answer">"Art can always be really beautiful, whether it's made on a computer or whatever else. My only concern is: 'what if the electricy goes out?'</p>

		<h2>Interview</h2>
		<ol class="interview">
			
			<li class="question">How old were you when you got your first computer?</li>
			<p class="answer"> I was twenty four years old when I got my first computer.</p>
			
			
			<li class="question">What was your favorite piece of technology when they were growing up?</li>
			<p class="answer"> My favorite piece of technology when I was growing up was my massive television.</p>

			
			<li class="question">How has technology changed over your lifetime?</li>
			<p class="answer">Technology has made everything much easier, you can do everything on over the phone like paying the bills and etc.<p/>

			

			<li class="question">Have the changes youâ€™ve seen in technology over your lifetime mostly helped or hurt society?</li>
			<p class="answer">Both but I would lean more towards hurt because the young generation are too used to phones that they are like zombies. Interaction between people one on one has been lost<p/>

			

			<li class="question">What is your greatest hope for technology in the future?</li>
			<p class="answer">My biggest hope for technology in the future is that it can become so big that diseases now, that can't be cured, can be cured like cancer.<p/>

			

			<li class="question">What is your greatest fear for technology in the future?</li>
			<p class="answer">My biggest fear is that we become more "dumb" instead of intelligent.<p/> 

			

			<li class="question">What advice would you like to share with the younger generation about tech- nology?</li>
			<p class="answer">My advice would be to use it wisely, be smart but be aware there are things more important.<p/>

			

			<li class="question">What was the name of your first computer?.</li>
			<p class="answer">The name of my first computer was DialUp, everything we used was called 'Americaonline' (AOL), and everytime we received a message, a voiceover would say "you got mail!"<p/>

		</ol>

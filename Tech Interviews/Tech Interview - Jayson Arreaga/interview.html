		<h1>Tech Interview</h1>
		

		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p id="introduction">In this interview I decided to ask my cousin a few questions on his experience with technology throughout his life especially since he is 26 that makes him a millenial which left him in the generation that grew up whn technology was evolving at a rate never seen before. He currently works as a tech floor manager at AMEX in Manhattan and deals with all different forms of technology.</p>

		<h2>Interview</h2>
		<ol class="interview">
			<li class="question">How old were you when you got your first computer?</li>
			<p class="answer">"My first computer was an old school gateway desktop that my mom got me when I was 11."</p>
			
			<li class="question">What was your favorite piece of technology when they were growing up?</li>
			<p class="answer">"Ever since i first got my hands on it, the Nintendo SP will forever be my favorite piece of tech growing up."</p>
			<li class="question">How has technology changed over your lifetime?</li>
			<p class="answer">"Over my lifetime technology quickly went from a commoditity to being a crucial and fundamental part of not only my life but everybodys. It has made things easier and it also has challenged myself to solve problems with a more tech savvy way."</p>
			<li class="question">Have the changes youâ€™ve seen in technology over your lifetime mostly helped or hurt society?</li>
			<p class="answer">"I believe the changes i've seen  in technology have aided society in which what was impossible is now a reality. For example being able to to take an entire class on a virtual tour of different cities across the globe via the internet while never leaving the very classroom you teach in is a revolutionary step in the right direction for education."</p>
			<li class="question">What is your greatest hope for technology in the future?</li>
			<p class="answer">"In short what I really hope for technology is the just the betterment of society. I want the world to be rid of all "incurable" diseases and for us to begin to use tech to further our civilization as a <b>planet</b>."</p>
			<li class="question">What is your greatest fear for technology in the future?</li>
			<p class="answer">"The only downside to the total tech takeover of daily life in my opinion is the lack of privacy that is becoming a more present problem."</p>
			<li class="question">What advice would you like to share with the younger generation about technology?</li>
			<p class="answer">"Well for the future generation, if we even have one, all I would be able to relay is never lose sight of of reality. I say this to establish that with technological advancement reaplacing tasks people would normally do, it is very easy to get lost and rely too much on tech."</p>
			<li class="question">What's one piece of technology that currently isn't available that you think could be the most useful in society today?</li>
			<p class="answer">"As cool as it would be to have a personal teleporter or a flying car i think the most useful thing society could benefit from would be an all in one scanner that would contain the abilities of an x-ray, MRI, Sonogram, and even blood tests or administering shots/assessing injuries."</p>

			<h4>Comment by Joshua</h4>
			<p>Picking your cousin was a great idea since he knows a lot about technology instead of picking someone who doesnt know much, i also think it was very well done.</p>

			<p>The writing aspect of your project was very well done, next you should try and add some padding to the website to make reading it a bit easier, as well as adding your own colors to make it yours.</p>

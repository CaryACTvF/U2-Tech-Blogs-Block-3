		<h1>Tech Interview</h1>
		<img src="" alt="">

		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p id="introduction"> Alcia Santiago,she has a carrer as a teacher at high school TVF.She was my math teacher from last year. </p>

		<h2>Interview</h2>
		<ol class="interview">
			<li class="question">The first computer I ever had access to was in the 5th grade in the computer room and they were ginormous computers.They were big and boxy and you had to use big floppy disks to use it.</li>
			
			<li class="question">What was your favorite piece of technology when they were growing up?When I was a kid ,they came out with a diary that had keyboard with a password and I liked to journal in there sometimes.</li>

			<li class="question">How has technology changed over your lifetime? In terms of advancement, they are able to do so much more but the packaging is much more sleek.Also the ability to find a computer is so different because now people can go buy a computer for no more than $200 because it was such a rarity to find someone with a computer in their house. </li>

			<li class="question">Have the changes youâ€™ve seen in technology over your lifetime mostly helped or hurt society? I think both, there's an ease of information that makes it easier to find out how to get the information you need but there's a flip to it because people don't communicate face to face lke they used to.</li>

			<li class="question">What is your greatest hope for technology in the future? That we continue to focus on more helpful ways for humanity.Maybe one day technolgy can help with real world problems instead of just personal issues.</li>

			<li class="question">What is your greatest fear for technology in the future? That we will go overboard and we will star implanting chips into people instead or real communication.</li>

			<li class="question">What advice would you like to share with the younger generation about tech- nology?Appreciate how easy and fast it is now because back in the day it took a few minutes to even get connected to the internet.  </li>

			<li class="question">Any favorite stories when you were younger? One of my favorite phones I had was a chirp chirp because it was kind of like a walkie talkie if you were close enough to your friends.</li>

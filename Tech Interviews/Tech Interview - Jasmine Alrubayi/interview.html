			<h4>Comment by William.</h4>
			<p> I really enjoy the style of the page, the colors are very nice and look well together. I liked that an image of beepers was shown after the question so the readers know what it is, because I did not know what it was. I would just reread and check on the spelling otherwise everything else is perfect.</p>

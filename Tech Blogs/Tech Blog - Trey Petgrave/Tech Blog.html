<h2>The revolution is coming!</h2>

<p>Many of us recognize robotic automation as an inevitably disruptive force. However, in a classic example of optimism bias, while approximately two-thirds of Americans believe that robots will inevitably perform most of the work currently done by human beings during the next 50 years, about 80% also believe their current jobs will either definitely or “probably exist in their current form within the same timeframe.

Somehow, we believe our livelihoods will be safe. They’re not: every commercial sector will be affected by robotic automation in the next several years.</p>



<p>comment from justin.I like how this is set up with the terminator as the image and the baground of the matrix and i agree with robots having an affect for people.</p>

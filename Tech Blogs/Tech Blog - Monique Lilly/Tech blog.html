	<h2>Will Human jobs become obsolete? </h2>


	<p> The creation of new robots are seeming to make human workers less useful. Robots can do a human job without the risk of human error and for a fraction of the cost. Although, robots can do tasks more efficiently once robots are prefect at these jobs they may completely replace human workers. If our society makes this transition there may be a large amount of unemployment. I see this as an unsettling development. </p>

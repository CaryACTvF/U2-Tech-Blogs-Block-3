	<h2> Robots are gonna take over </h2>

	<p> In the video "Humans Need Not Apply" it displays a look into what the future has in store for us. Electronics have already taken many jobs away from humans. When having humans on jobs, money is spent on their salary while with robots they dont have to pay them the same. Robots are slowly but surley replacing humasn and humans are becoming scared. </p>

	<p> Comment by Jack Haake: I agree with your statement that robots are going to take over the job market; it was an interesting point you brought about how we work for money whilst robots don't get anything from working. It was something I hadn't thought about yet.</p>

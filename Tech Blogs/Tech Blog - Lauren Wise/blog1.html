<h2>Human Replacement</h2>

<p>One day humans will be replaced by robots. It's scary but it's happening and it's happening fast. "The real question isn't how humans will be replaced but when." Most working humans will be out of a job from white-collars to low class workers. Machines may be slower than humans but they are less costly in the long run. About 45% of the jobs will get replaced, more then The Depression. </p>

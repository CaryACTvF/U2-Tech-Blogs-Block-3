	<h1>Do Robot Control Our Minds?</h1>
	<h2>Do robot own us already?</h2>
	<img src="https://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/humanrobot6.jpg" alt="Human in contact with human robot">
	<p>  After watching the video it left a stange inprint on me that we may already be controlled by robots.  I believe that robots may be in control already and they make us feel like we are in power but they make themselves seem like the lesser so that they can make up feel empowered.  To be quite frank, I've always been more afraid of robots tha any zombie or any life like thing that we could possibly come in counter with, and main reason for my fear is the fact that we come in contact with robots 24/7.  We are making robots that look so human, and we are making them stonger and more powerful, at least thats what we think that WE are doing.  Will we keep our control or will or own made allies become our enemies?  </p>

	<p> Comment by Joseph: I like what you have said because i feel the same way. Robots really scare me. The backround of your website was valid. so was the gradient.</p>
